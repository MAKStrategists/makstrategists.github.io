      <h1>About MAK Strategists</h1>
      <p class="section-intro">
        MAK Strategists exists to solve a problem most founders quietly struggle with: knowing what to say, how to say it, and where to show up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brands rarely fail because of weak execution alone. They fail because the thinking behind them is unclear. The story is inconsistent. The positioning is vague. 
        The audience is poorly understood. We’re here to change that.
      </p>
      <p>
        We bring meaning, psychology, and narrative alignment to your brand - so every visual, every post, every pitch, and every event reflects a clear identity.

      <h2>Our philosophy</h2>
      <div class="grid-2">
        <div>
          <p>We believe strategy is not a deck; it’s a way of thinking about your business. Our role is to help you see your brand clearly and then give you the tools to communicate that clarity to the world.</p>
          <p>We care about the soul of your business as much as the surface. That’s why we focus on positioning, psychology, and narrative; the foundations that give everything else meaning.</p>

        <div class="list-block">
          <ul>
            <li>Strategy before visuals.</li>
            <li>Clarity before content.</li>
            <li>Identity before execution.</li>
            <li>Intention before noise.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>How we think with you</h2>
      <p>
        We work best with founders, leadership teams, and businesses that are ready to move with intention. If you’re tired of scattered marketing efforts and disconnected messaging, 
        we help you step back, see the bigger picture, and build from a place of clarity.
