      <h1>Services</h1>
      <p class="section-intro">
        We provide direction, not execution. Our work focuses on the psychology, voice, and strategic clarity that shape how your brand is understood and remembered.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section section-alt">
      <h2>Brand positioning & identity</h2>
      <p>
        Define your voice, value, and competitive edge with intention. We help you articulate who you are, what you stand for, and why it matters — in language that resonates with the people you want to reach.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Audience psychology</h2>
      <p>
        We map how your buyers think, choose, and respond. This goes beyond demographics — into motivations, fears, decision patterns, and the emotional triggers that move them to act.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section section-alt">
      <h2>Narrative & story framework</h2>
      <p>
        Together, we design the narrative architecture of your brand: founder story, brand story, product story, and pitch messaging. The goal is simple: a story that feels true, travels well, and builds trust.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Marketing direction</h2>
      <p>
        We won’t run your channels, but we will tell you what belongs on them. From “what to post” and “where to post” to tone, themes, and content pillars, we create a direction your team can follow without guesswork.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section section-alt">
      <h2>B2B presence & event strategy</h2>
      <p>
        We help you decide which events matter, how to show up there, and how your decks, booths, and leadership presence should be designed to match your ambition and audience.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Execution, on your terms</h2>
      <p>
        We don’t execute — and that’s deliberate. Instead, we hand over a clear, practical blueprint your internal team or preferred partners can implement. When everyone knows the why, execution becomes easier, cheaper, and more focused.
